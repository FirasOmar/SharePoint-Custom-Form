******The Problem:******
</br>
The costumer need a form to enter huge amount of data to system ( like 800 items per day) and this items consists of many fields some of it needs to be updated and the other stay as it is for some bulk data(like the date and package title…etc) , it’s a tedious process for the  employee to use the default SharePoint Form or info-path form since they need to reopen the form after entering each item. furthermore, they can't see what they entered in the same form. Also with the default SharePoint form they can't take advantage of Bar-code reader to enter items to the system with less time and effort.
</br>
 ******what custom-form provide:******
</br>
Our custom-form solve the above problem and let the user enter as much items as he wants without any need to reopen the form or reenter all items but the needed, also the form let the user see what items entered to the system.
